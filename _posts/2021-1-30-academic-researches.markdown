The goal of Project Chen is to study procedural animation techniques which
- Generate animations look physically realistic
- Can be used in real-time applications
- Are affordable to indie game studios

The search for academic results is mainly in the computer graphics field and the robotics field.

Results from the computer graphics field provide kinematic methods, which generate trajectories or plans that are geometrically feasible, but are not necessarily feasible physically.
The benefit of these methods are that they are usually fast to be solved in real-time.

On the other hand, methods used in robotics can mostly generate physically feasible trajectories, and some are even able to generate complex gaits without prior knowledge.
The drawback is that they are usually expensive to compute.

In game industry, motion matching has been used more and more in AAA games, thanks to the maturation of motion capture techniques.
It can generate qualified and responsive locomotion animations and is very fast.
However, not all studios are affordable of motion capturing and data for non-humanoid characters are difficult to get.

Below I describe 5 papers that are very helpful for this project.

1. [Gait and trajectory optimization for legged systems through phase-based end-effector parameterization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8283570)
   
   The method I used in the game [Desolation Place](https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/desolation-place).
   It adopts trajectory optimization by collocation to calculate a trajectory satisfying a simplified body dynamics and contact constrains.
   
   It is able to generate believable animations, but not fast enough to be used in real-time.
   Moreover, since it enforces hard constrains, the solver can fail if the gait phases are not properly specified.

2. [Mode-adaptive neural networks for quadruped motion control](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3197517.3201366)
   
   A learning-based motion matching method that is suitable for quadruped characters.
   It solves the common problem encountered in naive motion matching methods, which is unbelievable results due to averaging inconsistent clips,
   by training a gaiting network to dynamically blend the specific motion modes.
   
   This method needs abundant classified motion capture data,
   but in terms of this project, data generated by trajectory optimization can be used to train the network.

3. [Discovery of complex behaviors through contact-invariant optimization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185520.2185539)
   
   An alternative to the already mentioned trajectory optimization method.
   It can be used on any given dynamics model, and is very good at dealing with contacts.
   By using soft constrains, I assume that it is easier to find a solution.
   It is also shown in the paper that this method can discover non-trivial but reasonable behaviors, which is very interesting to this project.

   For more details on this paper, see the first one of the [related videos](#related-videos).

4. [Interactive control of diverse complex characters with neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2969442.2969589)
   
   The work done by the same authors as the third paper.
   It learns a closed-loop policy from the trajectories calculated above.
   In order to solve the averaging problem as mentioned, it couples the training of the police with the generation of the trajectory.
   The result is a robust policy that can be executed in real-time.

   If this project ends up to use actual simulated bodies rather than kinematic ones, this can serve as a starting point.
   For more details, see the second one of the [related videos](#related-videos).

5. [An efficient acyclic contact planner for multiped robots](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8341955)
   
   A contact planner based on searching.
   It provides an efficient way to plan a sequence of contact points before executing.

   Though the results are always conservative, the way how it finds a reachable set is valuable.
   For this project, there may need some way to guide the path for the agent, and this may be what in need.
